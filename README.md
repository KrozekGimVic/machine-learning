#Machine Learning
Learning machine learning.

## Project Structure
- ```Learning``` directory has mostly usless stuff, that was written to learn the concepts behind the digits clasifier.
- ```old_main.py``` is a bad try at writing the digits clasifier. It has no mathematical opimizations therefore it's slow and useless.
- ```skynet.py``` is library that will be later used in application for digit classifying.
- ```server.py``` is a simple server that uses ```skynet.py``` to accept images and use them for learning.
Later it will be able to server engine.csv or recognize image by uploading it to the server
